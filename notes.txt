ben hillbern contact information

setup weekly meeting

0.) Update Ubuntu, version no longer supported (Consider Fedora)
1.) Zero Forcing Equalizers, MMSE Equalizers (Dont really work with colored noise)
2.) Started building the system around the Bliss Models, without USRP
3.) Waiting on Stuff from Ben Hillburn
4.) Antss Boards???--DONE
5.) Looking at method of minimizing differential correlation matrix through the use of Lagrange Multipliers
-iterative fixed point rule

6.) Rauch–Tung–Striebel (RTS) Smoother, not good results


Current Topics:
Equalizers:
LMS FDE Adaptive equalizers
RLS FDE Equalizers, use training and decision directed mode

Tweek example:
http://www.mathworks.com/products/communications/demos.html?file=/products/demos/shipping/comm/commadapteq.html




yellow power, V6 max voltage
lights will go on


900Mhz, 10 wavelengths distance between antenna's
FSK easy, with incoherent detection
BPSK harder,
PAM easy too


Jamming
-2 tone cone jammer


Next Steps:




Specs:
3 Scenarios
1.) No interfering signals/No ONR Bliss
-50 meter broadside transmission
-simple txt messages
-Visual: PSD (Spectrum Analyzer), screen of laptop, Overall Video of Robot

2.) Interfering Singals/ No Bliss
-Tone Jammer

3.) Interfering/ ONR Bliss
-Single jammer

4.) Interfering/ ONR Bliss
-Multiple signals in spectrum

5.) Interfering/ ONR Bliss
-Wideband Jammer
-Concurrent non-intential interference
