The transmitter will take an input from a locally stored file and transmit it on the desired frequency using DBPSK. The input file will be a text file containing the desired message, however due to the bytewise interpretation of the file, theoretically any file type should be compatible.

After taking the input data, the transmitter will packetize the data and transmit it on the desired frequency. This implementation (simple_tx) does not include error correction, however this can be added if required. 



Input

File containing data to be sent. Data sent bytewise.

Output

RF Out of USRP2, DPSK

Properties

Location of  data file
Desired transmit frequency

Function

The transmitter will read input from a precoded file, modulate it using DPSK and transmit the data on the desired frequency. 

Testing

Simple DPSK receiver with single antenna directly connected to the USRP2 will be used to verify proper data encoding, modulation, and transmission.
