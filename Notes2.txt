 bistromath> | cinjun: sure. in gnuradio usually your main application will take values from your blocks and do something intelligent with them. so the best approach is 
                       probably to have your top-level block read the PLL output and issue commands to the USRP based on that
		       [15:34] < bistromath> although, in SDR the easier approach is to just shift the frequency in software using a frequency-xlating FIR filter or add/subtract a constant from a 
		                             frequency-demodulated output.
					     [15:37] <      cinjun> | bistromath: So normally I would just make a flow-graph in my top-block and just use the run method.  I guess a good question would be, when I execute the 
					               run command were does the code start executing from?
						       [15:37] < bistromath> when you hit run, all it does is start gnuradio's scheduler calling work functions. so your source starts producing samples, and your sink starts consuming 
						                             them. all this happens outside of any top-level code; the top block just strings together hier blocks.
									     [15:38] < bistromath> if you want a separate main application, the way to do it is to start the top block running in its own thread and then interact with it from your main 
									                           application once it's running
												   [15:40] < bistromath> so: create a class for your top block which inherits from a Python thread class, instantiate it from your main application and set it running, and then 
												                         interact with your blocks (reading frequency offset, adjusting USRP frequency) from your main app.
															 [15:40] < bistromath> the gr-pager app does this, IIRC

															 [15:42] < bistromath> if you want, you can do frequency correction entirely within the flowgraph instead by creating/assembling a block which outputs frequency offset, (the PLL 
															                       freq detect block will do this), suitably low-pass filtering it, and then feeding that offset (multiplied by -1) to a VCO block which is then mixed with your 
																	                             incoming signal.
																				     [15:42] < bistromath> if that makes any sense.
																				     [15:43] < bistromath> in a PSK/FSK system you can instead use a subtract block and subtract from the output of your quadrature demod block.
																				     [15:43] < bistromath> instead of mixing and using a vco
																				     [15:45] <      cinjun> | I was just going to correct the usrp's center frequency instead of mixing again
																				     [15:49] <      cinjun> | The PLL freq detect block will give my the center freq, so I can just feed that back
																				     [15:51] < bistromath> yep
																				     [15:52] < bistromath> you will have to get the data from that block into the main app though
																				     [15:52] < bistromath> using a vector sink is the easiest way
